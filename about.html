				<h2>About the author</h2> <hr>

				<p id="para-lead"><span style="color:white;background:black;padding:4px">NEVER IN SEASON, ALWAYS ON TIME</span></p> 

				<p><author>R. Adriel Vasquez</author> is a Texas native born in 1982. He has never had a southern accent, and knows 20 Spanish words—14 of which are numbers. Adriel went to Prague in 2006 where he planned to stay for a year. He left 15 years later.</p>

				<p>His experience in Central Europe is exaggerated somewhat in the self-published novel <em><a href="novels/five-cigarettes.html">5 Cigarettes::. A Book About Love, Music, Sex, Death, and Rebith</a></em>, available from this website.</a></p> 

				<p>Adriel currently lives in Amsterdam, where he makes a living as a technical writer, and works on his next novel—which will be either a love story in Hell, or about parties in Prague c. 2017-19. Same difference.</p>

				<h3>WHAT THE AUTHOR IS ABOUT</h3>

				<p>On his blog <a href="life-design/lo-res-hi-life.html">LO-RES/HI-LIFE</a>, Adriel shares anecdotes (and antidotes) against the influence of seriousness, or field notes for wellness under dystopia.</p> 

				<p>Well acquainted with neurosis, abandonment and attachment issues, substance abuse and depression—Adriel dedicates his experience, research, and skills to helping anyone feeling lost, stuck, unrelatable, alone, and out of touch.</p>

				<p><em>LO-RES/HI-LIFE</em> is about learning to calm the fuck down, and live an authentic and creative life that generates and serves meaning first and foremost to yourself.</p> 

				<p>He has also collected some of his favorite photos over the years and published a book, which you can <a href="photography/just-a-pretty-face.html">check out here</a>.</p>

				<p>Adriel also makes fucked up music and visual art as <a href="http://aislenyne.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Aislenyne</a>.</p>
