			<p>Yeah sex is cool, but did you ever quit school to get married and move to Prague for a year, and while you’re there you join a band, see Europe, notice that you and your wife are seeing other people, stay in Prague and divorce two years later, watch your return flight pass overhead from the balcony you share with two Americans who vanish, restart school, make a short film with your bandmate about cannibals who seduce and ritualize the deaths of poets (while you are supposed to be writing your undergrad thesis on cultural diplomacy), work in the university library and teach unqualified but charismatic English to Czech professionals to pay tuition, sleep with one of your professionals who ghosts you after her boyfriend retrieves her from one of your “sessions," get kicked out the band, fall in love with a Russian classmate, meet her at movie nights hosted by an evangelical culture studies professor then smoke cigarettes and drink tequila in a tucked away pub, see more of Europe, graduate, stay in Prague, start graduate school, break up with your Russian girlfriend after she moves to study in another country (but really after you cheated on her while you were long-distance, although she was visiting at the time), date the Ukrainian with whom you cheated and who teaches you to roll cigarettes, finish graduate school, stay in Prague, work as Social Media Editor for a dubiously prestigious publisher, get away with tweeting for a living for two years, get fired, start a job you hate teaching ICT at a private school that exploits you, move in with your girlfriend who breaks your heart and then live alone for the first time in your life—all of which triggers engagement with trauma you hadn’t known you were carrying and being totally unaware and unprepared for that battle you choose addiction and distraction, live broke (in every sense), somehow get hired and hold your job as a technical writer, go to a garden party where you meet a Czech girl with an explosive smile whom you sense you had known in a previous life, fall in love with her and spend a month mutually assuring your destruction before she exits just as quickly, have your loneliest Christmas, blackout obscenely at a party no one talks about, meet once a week for drinks with the only friend who recognizes and sympathizes with your mania—meetings after which you disappear into the Prague underside often for a couple of days—walk yourself to the hospital where you stay for weeks, get to understand purgatory, spend more weeks yet in recovery and sense you should really get your shit together but your shit cannot be got together because you have no fucking idea what is the actual shit you fucking need to get together—and so you decide to take “joy in the horror,” a misaligned idea that backfires hilariously—but then in exhaustion you achieve moderate sobriety and the joy and the horror slow down, stay in Prague, start a tennis cult, socialize more in the daylight and sometimes at night and notice that people come into your life with uncanny contributions to your well-being, recommit to the living whatever that means and rebuild your life around tennis and whisky, and techno—which you started to love after that October with garden-party girl, accept an offer from a Dutch company, leave Prague after a 180-month year and move to Amsterdam where you sit at a whisky bar just after a global pandemic and reminisce about your experiences in Czech Republic, the love, the music, the sex, the death, and the rebirth: then you notice a pattern and you perceive the shit-together getting that goes back to your childhood and has kept your shit fucked for a long time but without sufficient force that you would notice because circumstances had not exhausted your maladaptive and subconscious coping-with-coping behaviors until you left home and had kept on leaving home and when there was no more home to leave you abandoned yourself and had kept on abandoning yourself because that’s what you had learned to do at home, notice your nervous system has been desperately trying to get your attention (probably since you were a teenager), start therapy, find yourself now simultaneously way behind and way ahead, crash and burn another relationship, rekindle the romance with garden-party girl over text who says she “will not run from us again,” propose to her on a summer visit to Prague immediately after which she moves to Amsterdam, live like good karma brought you back together (and not as if she had just escaped her own pack of cigarettes) and after you watch her feed pigeons in the park bits of lunch that you bought for the two of you a deep cut from 17 years earlier plays at Starbucks?</p>
