				<h2>What is a low-resolution high life?</h2> <hr>

				<p id="para-lead"><span style="color:white;background:black;padding:4px">WELCOME TO MY BLOG. I WRITE ANECDOTES AGAINST THE INFLUENCE OF SERIOUSNESS</span></p> 

				<p>LO-RES/HI-LIFE is a subversion of "lowlife and high tech," the desciption that speculative fiction writer William Gibson gives to the cyberpunk genre, where monolithic corporations act as governments, and techno-cultures algorithmically convert free human expression into sanctioned, impotent, and often weaponized impulses. For genuine human experience in cyberpunk, resisting and opting out of dystopia is usually self-exile, disadvantaged, and deadlyâ€”which is where the cyberpunk story grooms its lowlife, high-tech protagonists.</p>

				<p>As a genre, cyberpunk is hardly speculative. The Matrix has us. But LO-RES/HI-LIFE promotes a third way between dystopia and the desert of the real. Where cyberpunk fights the future, LO-RES/HI-LIFE makes love to it.</p>

				<p>Today in our dystopia, understanding how to design, cultivate, and protect our hearts and minds is a martial art. <em>LO-RES/HI-LIFE</em> is where I encapsulate my personal discovery and practice of that art, and share it with you. </p>
